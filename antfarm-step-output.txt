STATUS: done
CHANGES: Completed QA gate review on provided packet; identified that the actual brief and success criteria are missing, so a quality review cannot be executed. Issued STATUS: retry with concrete remediation items.
TESTS: 1) Validated claimed step input fields. 2) Checked workspace and sibling agent directories for a brief artifact (none found). 3) Confirmed checklist cannot be assessed without source brief.
RESULT:
STATUS: retry
ISSUES:
- BRIEF is missing ([missing: brief]); no deliverable text was provided to review or polish.
- SUCCESS_CRITERIA is missing ([missing: success_criteria]); acceptance thresholds are undefined.
- Because the brief is absent, checklist items 1-7 cannot be validated (coverage, citation quality, actionability, length, executive summary quality, risk clarity, CEO tone).
- Please resubmit with the full draft brief (including executive summary, top 3 services, >=5 current citations, key risks, and 3 concrete next actions) plus explicit success criteria.
